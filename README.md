## TreasureKoii Client

#### How to develop locally

The server is available [here](https://github.com/mehedikhan72/TreasureKoii-Api). Make sure you have the server running first.

Now follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository.
2. cd into the directory where ```package.json``` is in.
3. Run ```yarn start``` to start the client.

React client will be available at port 3000, unless that port is already being used.
